# Frontend Project

This repository contains the code for the frontend part of the speedcube timer web app and is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). The project was initially created with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and all requests to the backend are handled by [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

The look and feel of the website are created with the CSS framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
